All tests conducted on solutions of table sugar in a plastic container, within an enclosed light-blocking box.
Each dataset is organized into two CSV files: one with absorbance data for numbered samples measured using a LinkSquare NIR, and the other (called "...Refs") with known sugar concentrations for each sample as measured using a Brix meter.

--DATASETS SUMMARY--

TableSugarTop1: LinkSquare internal halogen light source, LinkSquare pointing down on top of clear open container

TableSugar1: LinkSquare internal halogen light source, LinkSquare pointing at side of clear open container

TableSugarLit1: external halogen light source, all collinear LinkSq--container--lightsource

control_solution: external halogen light source, all collinear LinkSq--container--lightsource, and using raw cane sugar (turbinado)
