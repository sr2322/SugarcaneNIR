--ABSTRACT--
Chemical and Nir spectra measurements were made on 60 sugarcane samples from different plant parts (leaves, stem or whole aerial part). Chemical parameters (total sugar content - TS, crude protein content - CP, acid detergent fiber - ADF, in vitro organic matter digestibility - IVOMD were determined. In parallel, reflectance spectra were measured using eight spectrometers. To illustrate, PLS-R results are showed for the total sugar content and crude protein contents.

--DATA ACQUISITION--
Absorbance spectra data were acquired by measurements on the following spectrometers: LabSpec 4 (ASD i.e. Analytical Spectral Devices, Boulder, CO, USA), NIRscan Nano (Texas instruments Inc., Texas, USA), F750 (Felix Instrument Inc., Camas, WA, USA), MicroNIR1700 (Viavi Solution, Milpitas, CA, USA), MicroNIR2200 (Viavi Solution, Milpitas, CA, USA), NIRONE 2.2 (Spectral Engines, Finland), SCIO (Consumer Physics, Tel Aviv, Israel), and TellSpec (Tellspec Inc., Toronto, Ontario, Canada).
