# SugarcaneNIR
Using Near-Infrared Spectroscopy to determine sugar concentrations in sugarcane noninvasively.
A PLS-R model was developed using empirical data on sugarcane samples, and demonstrated a cross-validation regression coefficient of 0.902 and mean absolute error of ±0.97° Brix.

All spectral data was collected on a LinkSquare NIR handheld spectrophotometer using the LinkSquare Collector LS application.
Included are empirical datasets as well as Python scripts to analyze and visualize data.

A good introduction to PLS (Partial Least Squares) is provided here: pls-manual.pdf
